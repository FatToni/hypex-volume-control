With this software tool you are able to control the volume from an Hypex PSC2.400d Amlifier with usb connection. The reason for this project is I want to control my stereo speakers with an raspberry pi. In each speaker is one PSC.400d installed. You can connect both amplifier with usb to the raspberry (or other linux based system) at the same time. 
I you use the SPDIF connection to transfer audio signals from any device to the Hypex PSC2. In this case many devices like Amazon Fire Stick or a playstation did not support volume control.
With this tool you can use the Hypex internal volume control over usb.

A connected IR sensor to the raspberry allowes me to use any remote control device for example this from my panasonic tv.

Have fun

The hidapi-0.7.0 lib is necessary to get it running.
